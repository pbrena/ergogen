Can be done with Kicad 7.
Select a whole area using mouse (Hold left button down to form an area) or left click individual lines whilst holdig down cmd key.

When selection complete:
Right mouse click / Create from Selection / Create tracks from selection / then select layer from Pop-up.

The tracks now exist under the still showing graphic lines. Move or delete the graphic lines to see the tracks.

There is also a function for this in the Hot Key list in Preferences / Preferences in the PCB area.

There are a lot of features in the Right Mouse Click Select menu.
